## **Welcome to my profile**

I keep things simple: I build solutions that remove mess, reduce manual work, and help your business run smoother.

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Automation Engineer, which means I design, develop, and deploy automation systems end-to-end so you donâ€™t have to worry about tools breaking or processes failing.

I aim for near-perfect execution. Clean builds, reliable systems, clear documentation, full walkthroughs, and proper support for you and your team.
